# CAN Sender for generic CAN Interfaces (CAN API V3)

Copyright &copy; 2025 by Uwe Vogt, UV Software, Berlin (info@uv-software.com)

## Utility program `can_send`

`can_send` is a command line tool to send CAN messages that are entered at the program prompt.
The syntax is taken from the Linux SocketCAN utility [can_utils\cansend](https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils/tree/master).

### Syntax

```
 <can_frame>:
  <can_id>#{data}                     for CAN CC data frames
  <can_id>#R{len}                     for CAN CC remote frames
  <can_id>##<flags>{data}             for CAN FD data frames (up to 64 bytes)
 <can_id>:
  3  ASCII hex-chars (0 .. F) for Standard frame format (SFF) or
  8  ASCII hex-chars (0 .. F) for eXtended frame format (EFF)
 {data}:
  0 .. 8   ASCII hex-values in CAN CC mode (optionally separated by '.') or
  0 .. 64  ASCII hex-values in CAN FD mode (optionally separated by '.')
 {len}:
  an optional 0 .. 8 value as RTR frames can contain a valid DLC field
 <flags>:
  one ASCII hex-char (0 .. F) which defines CAN FD flags:
    4 = FDF                           for CAN FD frame format
    5 = FDF and BRS                   for CAN FD with Bit Rate Switch
    6 = FDF and ESI                   for CAN FD with Error State Indicator
    7 = FDF, BRS and ESI              all together now
```

## CAN Interface API, Version 3

**CAN API V3** is a wrapper specification by UV Software to have a uniform CAN Interface API for various CAN interfaces from different vendors running under multiple operating systems.

## Git repo `can_send`

This repo only contains the source code for the utility program `can_send` to be integrated into CAN API V3 wrapper implementations as a git submodule.
